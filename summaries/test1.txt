“A chess match first half and a boxing match second,” said England manager Phil Neville of “an unbelievable advert for women’s football”.
A stunning Steph Houghton free-kick had cancelled out an equally impressive Megan Rapinoe strike before Nikita Parris gave England a 2-1 lead against the USA in their SheBelieves Cup match in Nashville.
A Rapinoe corner caused chaos in England’s penalty box before Abby McManus was able to power a clearance off the line.
With the USA pressing high, the Lionesses were reeling on the back foot, but a succession of corners for the host side came to little and slowly Neville’s team began to relax.
Tobin Heath scores the USA’s second, beating a group of England defenders to equalise.

England picked up where they had left off from the beginning of the second half, and Fran Kirby flicked the ball to Parris who slid the ball beyond Franch and into the corner to give the visitors a 52nd minute lead.
